# servant
my slack bot/servant, built with slack_bolt

It is pretty basic, but has the following features/commands:
* greet new channel members
* /dice [minNum] [maxNum] - roll a dice (generate a random number)
* /test-servant - output channel id & user slack id
* /reminder [reminder] [mins] - sets a reminder for me
* /sleep - for when i finally sleep, pings me at 6:45am next day
